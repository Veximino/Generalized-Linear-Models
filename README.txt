Generalized Linear Models

MNIST training and testing dataset used alongside Logistic Regression to execute a system of basic 
character recognition.

Digits 0 through 9 will be tested using logistic regression modeling

Each dataset consists of thousands of 28x28 grayscale images that are encoded with different integer
values between 0 and 255. The first column represents digit labels while the rest are pixel values for the
images
