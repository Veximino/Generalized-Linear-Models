Generalized Linear Models

MNIST training and testing dataset used alongside Logistic Regression to execute a system of basic 
character recognition.

Digits 0 through 9 will be tested using logistic regression modeling

Each dataset consists of thousands of 28x28 grayscale images that are encoded with different integer
values between 0 and 255. The first column represents digit labels while the rest are pixel values for the
images



Generalized linear models are a great technique that can be utilized to help us train and test models alongside logistic regression. We can then use the models to make predictions. Based on our results from softmax, the max probability was roughly 0.232 which means that our predicted digit will be 2. After checking the actual digit, it is also 2, so our prediction was correct based on the softmax. The accuracies for the models are all over 94%.
